# Country Autosuggest

Uses iso-3166-2 and fuse.js to create a simple searchable dropdown for countries which supports fuzzy matching.

Navigate options with arrow keys and select with Enter/Tab or mouse. Escape or click outside to close the dropdown.

In a real project I'd probably use an existing component [like this](https://mui.com/components/autocomplete/).
